# u80a-buyer
This python script waits for the release of the u80a-seq1 keyboard extras on ramaworks.store and completes checkout for you to try and get the board you want. 

All of the releases for nice keyboards/keyboard accessories are heavily botted and a lot of people miss out on them, so hopefully this gives others a chance to get a nice board they want in the future :).
